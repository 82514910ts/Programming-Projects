    "First create a program below that prompts the user for a file. That file should just be a list of numbers (I used 1 2 3 each on their own line). It then calculates and outputs the mean/average and standard deviation (SD) of those numbers (using print()). The formula to use for the SD is found through the following mini-algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the average of the values.\n",
    "2. Find the sum of the square of the difference between each item you read in and the average. So, if I only have 3 inputs 1,2,3, the average is 2 so the sum of the square of the differences is: (2-1)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (2-3)^2 = 2 (in this example).\n",
    "3. Divide the value in the previous step by (n-1) (for n numbers). In my above example, that would be 2/2 = 1.\n",
