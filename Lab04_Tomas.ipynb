    "This lab is designed to get you some additional practice with while loops in Python. We will do so by building a program we already know how to do and then slowly add loops.  You do not need to save earlier steps as you go separately - just change what you have (if you really want to, copy/paste your code to a separate cell before continuing and making changes).  The final goal is a single program incorporating all steps. The entire assignment, with all steps correctly implemented, will be worth 30 points."

We will be taking as input magnitude as a float and then outputting the appropriate Abbreviated Modified Mercalli Intensity (AMMI) for that magnitude using that first table (the one with descriptions).

Fix your code so that you round to the nearest tenth - thus, this particular error is avoided (i.e., if I type 3.91, it will round to 3.9 and output II; if I type 3.97, it rounds to 4.0 which is output IV)."
