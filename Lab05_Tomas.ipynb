    "B. fromMilitary(hours, minutes) has two parameters that must be integers and returns a string that is that time converted to \"standard\" time from \"military\" time. For example, fromMilitary(14,20) returns \"2:20 PM\" and fromMilitary(8,42) returns \"8:42 AM\". For the invalid case, you just need to see if the return value is a string - this is done through isinstance(result,str).\n",

    "C. removeDigits(string) has a single string parameter. It returns a new string that has all the digits (aka characters that return True from isdigit() ) removed. For example, removeDigits(\"H88i23\") returns \"Hi\", removeDigits(\"123\") returns \"\", and removeDigits(\"Hello\") returns \"Hello\". The invalid test is the same as for fromMilitary - return True if the input is a str.\n",
