If you don't know what it is doing (likely due to the poor style), definitely talk with others and, if need be, the SI or Dr. Meier. You can't fix the style of a program without knowing what it does! You are allowed to restructure the program as long as it runs in the same way (no new inputs or prints) and has the same functions (albeit with new, appropriate names). Be sure to change the output and prompts to make sense given the purpose of the code - in particular, the printing of the list should also mention what is being listed and not have \"[\" or \"]\".

In both cases, it will then ask you again if you want any chikon. (You can do whatever you would like to get this to happen - adding a new function is not required).
