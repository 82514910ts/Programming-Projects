NOTE: FOR NOW, the face only needs to look good for a single input - put this pixel input as a comment in your code somewhere prominent so I know what value you had working at some point.

Using these tools, generate a y-value between 0 and canvas.height()-radius\\*2 (that is, the height of the canvas minus the height of your circle so the circle stays on the page), an x-value between 0 and canvas.width()-radius\\*2, and set the anchor point of the yellow circle to that position. For example, if my canvas is 400x400 and I input a radius of 100, then I would generate an x_value between 0 and 200 then a y_value between 0 and 200 to use that as the anchor point for the yellow circle.
